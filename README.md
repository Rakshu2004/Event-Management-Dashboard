The entire source code for the Event Management Dashboard is provided and organized as follows:

HTML: index.html for the main structure of the application.

CSS: styles.css for styling and ensuring a responsive, user-friendly design.

JavaScript: script.js for implementing functionality like managing events, attendees, tasks, and task progress tracking.

And for backend data storage i have used local storage because due to some inssues i was n't able to install and access mongodb even after many trials.
